# kalman-filter
For this project I applied the Kalman Filter to positional observations of a launced projectile. I used the filter to predict future positions given incomplete observations in order to map the probable trajectory of the object. I then applied the filter in reverse and predicted the origin from which the object was launched, given some positional observations taken in the middle of the object's flight path.
